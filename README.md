## FRONT-END

This project was generated by [Piotr Świątek](https://github.com/piotrek12101999) and
it's being developed as open-source project in order to help young IT students at KMT (and not only)
improve their coding skills

### Quick message

I'm aware that steps that I'm about to list down below can be quite boring or suprising for more advanced and experienced developers but this project is meant to be good start point for students and newbies. :information_desk_person:

<br />
P.S I'm human, <strike> I make mistakes </strike> so this project might have some things that are overengineered or just stupid and can be done better, feel free to contribute then!

P.S 2 Yeah I'm aware and ashamed of `@ts-ignore`
